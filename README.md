### Work Experience
**Data Scientist @ Gaia-AI (_April 2025 -Present_)**
- Faced with the challenge of locating endangered species with limited field data, I led the analysis of telemetry, image, and manual data to build ML/DL models that predict animal movement patterns.
- Collaborated with ecology experts to test behavior hypotheses using AI, enabling strategic interventions for species protection.
- Applied data mining, time series, and forecasting techniques, influencing data-driven conservation policies.

**Graduate Research Assistant @ Sanjose State University (_Jan 2025 - Present_)**
- Researched about patent assignees, analyzed data of 3000 patent assignees, searched about their contact information to find if they are immigrants.
- Analyzed the data finding by collaborating with head of entreprenuership department at SJSU, increased the percentage of finding the right information about patent assignee by 90%.

**Data Analytics Consultant @IBM India (_Jan 2015 - Dec 2024_)**
 ***Project: Product Analytics for Predictive Maintenance***
 - Faced with frequent industrial asset failures impacting business continuity, provided solutions to improve operational
reliability through analytics.
 - Applied time series forecasting and KPI-based monitoring to predict breakdowns and proactively schedule maintenance.
 - As a result, asset downtime was reduced by 30% and maintenance efficiency significantly improved

 ***Project: Document Summarization Tool***
 - IBM's legal team needed a tool to summarize lengthy legal documents efficiently,developed a document summarization tool using NLP techniques and LLMs.
 - Implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow using LangChain and fine-tuned a large language
model to enhance performance. Worked with the legal team to integrate the tool into their workflow.
 - Reduced document review time by 40% and improved summary accuracy by 20%.
   
***Project: Supply Chain Optimization***
  - To solve rising inventory costs and delivery inefficiencies, shown leadership skills by leading the product development of
demand forecasting models using Python, SQL, and data mining techniques .
 - The models identified key seasonal trends and forecasted demand at SKU level. This strategic insight reduced inventory
holding costs by 15% and improved order fulfillment times by 20%.

***Project: A/B Testing & Experimentation for Customer Engagement***
 - To improve feature adoption, collaborated with product managers and cross functional teams to define key products
metrics such as churn, retention, and conversion rates.
 - Designed and executed controlled A/B and multivariate experiments, generating actionable insights that guided feature
enhancements and increased user engagement by 15%.

***Project: SAP ECC to SAP ECC data migration, Client- Kraft Heinz (USA)***
 - Developed and maintained scalable data pipelines using ETL methodology (SAP Data Services and SAP Data Services Management Console) to support data migration and ensure high-quality data availability. 
 - Integrated and loaded data into SAP ECC target systems using LSMW, IDOC, and custom programs, achieving a 95% success rate in record processing while ensuring data reliability. 
 - Executed comprehensive test cases, reconciled source against target data, and collaborated with cross-functional teams to provide data-driven insights that enhanced data quality and stakeholder satisfaction.

***Project: SAP Data Conversion analysis,Client- Schlumberger (USA)***
- Designed Strategy for developing ETL pipelines for data migration using SAP Business object data services to extract data from RDBMS source system, reducing data integration time by 25%, Loaded the data into SAP ECC target systems.
- Analyzed the failed data output files of transformation phase and provided data driven solutions on the failed data patterns to reduce the number of iterations of Agile software cycle complexity by 10%.

**Masters Academic Project**
***Intelligence-Based Data-Driven Machine Learning Model for Autonomous Vehicle Testing***
 Tech Stack: Python, Flask API, Amazon S3, Mongo DB, Google colab, VS code, YOLOV10, Mask Faster RCNN, METECNN, MySQL
- Designed system and Developed scenario test case automation of autonomous vehicle, by implementing Data-Driven machine learning models to detect city street objects (Moving and Static objects) on trip videos, images and texts.
- Built input-context-output tree logic to enable dynamic test suite creation across multiple routes, significantly improving
testing coverage and operational efficiency
